# Living Notes - Burien Best Care Home Website

## Design Decisions

### Gallery + Blog (June 5, 2026)
Shipped `/gallery` and a 15-article blog.

**Gallery:** masonry grid (CSS `columns-1 sm:2 lg:3`) + custom lightbox. Uses the legacy sage/forest/cream class aliases (which now resolve to the neutralized slate/clay palette) so it sits inside the existing theme without new tokens. Lightbox uses a plain `<img>` (images are pre-optimized webp) while the grid uses `next/image`. "Our Home" pinned above the "Spring Planting Party" event section — the pattern for future events is a new `const <event>Images` array + section in `gallery-content.tsx`.

**Blog content model:** posts live as typed objects in `src/content/posts.ts` (`Block[]` per body: `p | h2 | h3 | ul | quote`). Deliberately **no MDX / markdown runtime** — instead a ~40-line `renderInline()` in the article route handles `**bold**`, `*italic*`, and `[text](href)` links. Authoring flow is markdown-in-`blog/` → Node generator → `posts.ts` (generator is scratch, not committed; re-author from it if regenerating).

**Blog hero images:** 16:9, `next/image`, sourced from Unsplash (warm/human/nature/home — explicitly avoided clinical/corporate stock). Works in static export because `next.config` already sets `images.unoptimized: true` + an `images.unsplash.com` remotePattern. **Brand rule still stands: replace stock with real photography when available.** Optional `videoUrl` field on a post renders a responsive 16:9 YouTube/Vimeo embed in place of the still hero (future use).

**Cross-link hygiene:** internal `/blog/*` links that point at not-yet-written articles are de-linked at generation time (anchor text kept) rather than shipped as 404s. When those articles get written, re-running the generator re-activates the links automatically.

**Nav order:** Home, About, Services, Gallery, Is It Time?, Next Steps, Blog, Contact (Footer mirrors, plus Schedule a Visit).

### Sunshine Polish Pass (April 22, 2026 — Phase C)
Second iteration on the glassmorphic redesign. Brett flagged that slate-blue H1s read too cool, terracotta accent bars looked brown/muddy, and the CTA button didn't pop. Locked in **sunshine yellow** as the site's single accent/pop color — "lemons in a glass bowl on a kitchen table" energy.

**New tokens (in addition to the Phase B palette):**
- Sunshine: `#F3B94D` — pop accent, filled CTA buttons, horizontal accent bars, italic highlights on dark surfaces.
- Sunshine Deep: `#D99A2B` — CTA hover, italic highlights on light surfaces, sunshine-deep button hover.

**Homepage changes:**
- Hero H1 color: slate → **ink** (`#1A2028`, near-black) for maximum weight + readability.
- "safety" italic in the H1: moss green → **sunshine deep**, italic, font-semibold.
- Schedule a Visit button (`ScheduleVisitButton` component, all four `surface` variants): outlined clay → **filled sunshine with dark ink text**, deep-sunshine on hover.
- Every `<GlassCard variant="white">` on the homepage → **`variant="glass"`** so cards read as true frosted glass over the warm-cream backdrop.
- `GlassCard` `tinted` variant: mint-tinted → **sunshine-tinted frosted glass** (`rgba(253,244,222,0.55)` body with sunshine-deep-tinted border).
- Feature-grid accent bars ("Two Futures…", "Care Shaped Around Your Family"): all 10 bars now sunshine, consistent across sections.
- "stepping up" italic emphasis → sunshine deep; "What Becomes Possible?" italic on the dark card → sunshine.
- "What Happens If You Do Nothing?" italic "Nothing" and "can't unsee" phrases kept in slate (problem-agitation tone) with a sunshine underline accent — warmth without making warning copy read cheery.

**Inner pages (about, services, contact, next-steps) — same transforms batched:**
- All `bg-terracotta`/`bg-terracotta-deep` horizontal accent bars → sunshine.
- All `text-terracotta[-deep] italic` emphasis on light surfaces → sunshine-deep italic font-semibold.
- All outlined `border-terracotta-deep` CTA buttons → filled sunshine buttons with ink text.
- Uppercase-eyebrow pill labels (`text-terracotta` on light bg) → `text-slate-soft` for legibility.

**Backdrop simplification:**
- The 3-blob radial gradient backdrop (moss top-right + slate bottom-left + clay bottom-right) from Phase B read as "dirty" against section transitions. Replaced with a single soft sunshine wash at 88% -10% (12% opacity) over a clean `cream → bone` vertical gradient. Grain overlay preserved.

**Forms left alone:** `ContactForm`, `OpenHouseForm`, and the terracotta-deep error text / required-field asterisks stay muted clay so validation states remain high-contrast and unambiguous. The `terracotta` tokens are NOT aliased to sunshine — instead, sunshine is its own explicit token and applied directly where the pop is wanted.

### Glassmorphic Redesign (April 22, 2026)

Full visual refresh away from the terracotta/pink-peach palette. The site now reads modern, natural, and Mac-like.

**New palette (primary tokens):**
- Slate: #2D3E4A (primary dark — headlines, deep accents)
- Slate Soft: #3A4D5A (secondary dark)
- Moss: #5A6E58 (primary brand green)
- Moss Light: #8FA58B (secondary green)
- Fog: #E8ECE6 (cool section wash)
- Bone: #FDFBF7 (warm off-white)
- Clay: #B8876B (warm accent, minimal use)
- Clay Deep: #8F6245 (warm accent dark)
- Ink: #1A2028 (body text)
- Ink Soft: #4A5560 (secondary text)

**Legacy token aliases (auto-map in globals.css so old class names still work):**
- `bg-sage` / `text-sage` → moss (#5A6E58)
- `bg-cream` → warmer off-white (#F7F3EC)
- `bg-terracotta-light` → cool fog (#E8ECE6)  *(was the pink-peach)*
- `bg-terracotta` → clay (#B8876B)
- `text-forest` → deep slate (#2D3E4A)  *(this kills the green-on-H1 readability issue)*

**Backdrop system (globals.css):**
- Body uses layered radial gradients + a linear cream→fog wash, `background-attachment: fixed`.
- `body::before` overlays a low-opacity SVG fractalNoise grain (data URI, 300x300 tile, opacity 0.035, `mix-blend-mode: multiply`) for a subtle paper texture.
- `main`, `nav`, `footer` are set to `position: relative; z-index: 1` so the backdrop sits underneath.
- `h1, h2, h3, h4` default to `var(--color-slate)`.

**Glass system:**
- `.glass-panel` utility class: `backdrop-filter: blur(22px) saturate(130%)`, semi-transparent bone background, subtle inset highlight, soft slate-tinted drop shadow, 1.25rem radius.
- `GlassCard` component now supports three variants: `glass` (default, ~62% bone blur), `white` (solid bone), `tinted` (moss-tinted frosted glass — replaces the old `terracotta` variant).
- Accessibility: `@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce)` strips backdrop-filter and falls back to 95% opaque bone.

**Section background rule:**
- Inside page files, `<section>` tags use `bg-transparent` so the body backdrop shows through.
- For contained content that needs a surface, wrap in `<div className="glass-panel p-8 sm:p-12 lg:p-16 ...">`.

### Copywriting Framework (April 9, 2026)
Applied integrated Dan Kennedy + Alex Hormozi + Donald Miller StoryBrand framework:
- **StoryBrand SB7 structure** flows through the entire homepage: Character (family) > Problem (fear/guilt) > Guide (our team) > Plan (3 steps) > CTA (dual) > Failure stakes > Success vision
- **Primary ICP**: Adult daughter, 38-55, making care decisions for aging parent
- **Voice**: Speaks directly to guilt, overwhelm, and fear of making the wrong choice
- **Headlines** address PAIN, not welcome messages. Example: "Your parent's safety shouldn't keep you up at night."
- **Services framed as OUTCOMES** (Hormozi value stacking), not features. Example: "A home, not a room number" instead of "Home-Like Environment"
- **Dual CTAs on every page**: Direct ("Schedule a Visit") + Transitional ("Download Our Family Guide")

### Technology Migration (April 9, 2026)
Migrated from static HTML/CSS/JS to Next.js:
- Chose App Router for modern routing and metadata API
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@theme` tokens in `globals.css` (all color/font tokens live there)
- Framer Motion replaces vanilla JS Intersection Observer for animations
- Static export enabled for Vercel deployment compatibility
- Google Fonts loaded via `next/font/google` (DM Serif Display + Inter)

### Typography
- DM Serif Display 400: Headlines only (defaults to slate color)
- Inter 300-700: Body text, navigation, buttons
- Minimum body text: 18px (clamp for responsiveness)

### Content Rules (Permanent)
- NEVER use em dashes anywhere in copy
- No clinical or institutional language
- Wellness brand aesthetic, not healthcare aesthetic
- Photography: candid caregiving moments, NOT posed, NOT looking at camera

## Phase D Glass Overhaul (April 22, 2026)
Brett's feedback after Phase C shipped: the "What Life Looks Like" card cluster (Attentive Care / Purpose and Joy Daily / You Welcome Anytime) still read as eggshell-yellow boxes, and the glass effect wasn't catching anywhere. He explicitly called out the Memory Care / Daily Living Assistance cards as the look he wanted — those were already `variant="glass"`, the unlovely ones were `variant="tinted"`.

**Root cause:** Two issues compounded.
1. The `tinted` variant still used a warm `rgba(253,244,222,0.55)` fill with a sunshine-deep border — effectively an eggshell swatch, not glass.
2. Even the `glass` variant had no color variance to catch because the body backdrop was a uniform soft wash. `backdrop-blur` only reads as glass when there's something colored behind it to diffuse.

**Fix (shipped in 2 commits on master):**
1. `GlassCard.tsx`: rewrote BOTH `tinted` and `glass` to the same Apple-style frosted-glass formula — `backdrop-blur-2xl backdrop-saturate-200` on `bg-white/35` (tinted) / `bg-white/40` (glass), bright `border-white/60-65`, strong inset highlight, slate-tinted drop shadow. The two variants are now effectively identical treatments with only ~5% opacity differential, so the Attentive Care cluster now looks the same as the Memory Care cluster — which is exactly what Brett asked for.
2. `page.tsx`: dropped `bg-stone-50` from the Three Steps section, added `relative bg-transparent` to three sections (Three Steps, What Life Looks Like, Care Shaped Around Your Family), and injected 2–3 blurred colored blobs per section as ambient sectional washes. Moss + sunshine + slate-tint behind What Life Looks Like; clay + moss + sunshine behind Care Shaped; moss + slate behind Three Steps. Each blob is `absolute` inside a `pointer-events-none` overlay container so they sit behind the cards without affecting click targets.

**Why this works:** The ambient blobs give the backdrop-blur filter actual color variance to diffuse, so the cards now read as frosted glass floating over colored light — the Apple / visionOS look Brett's been asking for. Because both variants use the same frost formula, the "two card clusters look the same" feedback is resolved by design, not by guessing which variant is which.

**Note on `tinted` variant semantics:** `tinted` is retained as a named variant for future flexibility (e.g. if we want to differentiate clusters later with a slight color shift), but currently points at the same formula as `glass`. If we later want visual differentiation between card clusters, reintroduce a subtle hue (maybe 8% moss or 6% clay tint) instead of a full eggshell fill — the ambient washes behind the section should do most of the differentiation work.

### Phase D.2 — body-level sunshine radial removed (April 22, 2026)
After Phase D's glass overhaul landed, live screenshots still showed yellow behind right-column cards. Traced to the body-level `radial-gradient(ellipse at 88% -10%, rgba(243,185,77,0.12))` with `background-attachment: fixed` — this was painting a sunshine wash over the right edge of every viewport regardless of which section was on screen. Removed entirely from `globals.css`. Body is now pure cream→bone linear gradient + grain overlay. Sunshine accent color lives exclusively in CTA buttons + italic accent words ("safety", "can't unsee", "stepping up"). Cards now read as clean cream-frost everywhere.
