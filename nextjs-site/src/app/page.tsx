    {
      question: 'What if my parent hates it here?',
      answer:
        'We understand this is a real concern. That\'s why we have a detailed transition plan for every new resident. The first week includes gradual introduction to our home, routines, and team. We provide daily updates to families and work closely with your loved one to ensure a comfortable adjustment. We\'ve found that when families stay involved and visit regularly, the transition is smoother. Your loved one will have time to adjust, and we\'re with them every step of the way.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is an adult family home and how is it different from assisted living?',
      answer:
        'An adult family home is a small, intimate residential setting licensed to care for up to eight individuals. Unlike larger assisted living facilities that can house hundreds of residents, our adult family home provides a true home-like environment with personalized, individualized care. Our residents are family, not room numbers, and benefit from the warmth, attention, and genuine connection that only a true home can provide.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does this cost? Can we afford it?',
      answer:
        'Care costs vary based on the level of care required. Our rates are competitive with other facilities in the area. Many families use long-term care insurance, VA benefits, Medicaid COPES program, or private pay to cover costs. We work with families to understand their financial situation and explore all available options. We\'re committed to helping you find a solution that works for your budget. Schedule a consultation to discuss pricing and payment options specific to your situation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if their needs change over time?',
      answer:
        'Care needs often evolve, and we\'re prepared for that. We conduct regular assessments with families to ensure our care plans stay aligned with your loved one\'s current needs. If needs change significantly, we work with you and their medical team to adjust care or discuss alternative options. Our goal is always to provide the right level of care at the right time.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will they get enough attention with other residents?',
      answer:
        'This is one of the biggest differences between Burien Best Care Home and larger facilities. We care for a maximum of eight residents. That means your parent isn\'t competing for staff attention with dozens of others. Our small size allows for genuine relationships and individualized care that simply isn\'t possible in larger settings.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we visit almost any time?',
      answer:
        'Almost any time, yes. Family visits are warmly welcomed at Burien Best Care Home, and we encourage family involvement in your loved one\'s care and daily activities. Our visiting hours run loosely from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. so we can respect the routines of our residents. Within that window, visit whenever works best for your schedule. Your presence matters, and we love seeing families connected and engaged.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What types of care do you provide?',
      answer:
        'We provide comprehensive care including memory care for seniors with dementia or Alzheimer\'s, daily living assistance with bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal hygiene, respite care for family caregivers who need short-term relief, and post-hospital recovery support. Each resident receives a personalized care plan tailored to their unique needs, preferences, and goals.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if there\'s an emergency?',
      answer:
        'Safety is our top priority. Our team is trained in emergency response and has 24/7 access to medical protocols and emergency services. We work closely with local hospitals and coordinate care with your loved one\'s medical providers. Families are notified immediately of any health concerns. You can rest assured your parent is always monitored and supported.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens during the first week?',
      answer:
        'We have a thoughtful transition plan for every new resident. Day one focuses on getting comfortable with the space and meeting the team. The first week introduces routines, activities, and deeper adjustment. Every transition looks a little different. Some go quickly. Others take longer, with more bumps along the way. We will stay in close communication with you throughout, and together we will do our best to make the road as smooth as possible. Moving to a new home is significant, and we treat it with care and attention.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Burien Best Care Home licensed?',
      answer:
        'Yes, Burien Best Care Home is licensed by the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). We are bonded and insured, meeting all state requirements for adult family homes. You can verify our license and check our compliance record with DSHS. We maintain the highest standards of care and regulatory compliance.',

                  A missed medication. A fall they didn&rsquo;t tell you about. Meals skipped because cooking feels overwhelming now.
                  You notice your parent moving slower, forgetting more, struggling with things they used to do without thinking.
                  And the guilt hits hard.

                <p className="text-ink-soft text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Then there&rsquo;s the bigger thought: the idea of placing them somewhere else. It feels like giving up.
                  Like admitting you can&rsquo;t handle this alone. Like you&rsquo;re abandoning them when they need you most.
